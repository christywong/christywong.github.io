					<h5>Problem</h5>
					<p>Planning trips can be a hassle. There's <span class="emphasize">a lot of places you may want to visit</span> and you have to <span class="emphasize">figure out directions</span> from one place to another. There's also the problem of <span class="emphasize">not knowing where you want to go when traveling</span>.</p>

					<h5>Our Solution</h5>
					<p>With RoadRunner, users can <span class="emphasize">add locations they wish to visit</span> and rearrange that list with an easy drag and reorder feature. Since RoadRunner is connected to the Google Maps API, <span class="emphasize">a path with directions will be automatically generated</span> for the users to see. If they don't know where to visit and want some ideas, they can use the Explore tab and <span class="emphasize">see what lists other users have created and save it for future reference</span>.</p>

					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/storyboard.png" alt="RoadRunner Storyboard">

					<h5 class="subheaders">Planned Features</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Map displays the user's current location and nearby locations (ex. coffee shops, beaches, concert halls) that are part of other users' playlists. Users can choose to use these playlists or create their own.</li>
						<li>A search bar allows the user to search for playlists based on specific locations, time duration, or mood.</li>
						<li>The mood feature would ask the user how they're feeling and present a couple of options (ex. adventurous, curious, relaxed). If a user chooses adventurous, they see playlists that include hiking trails, surfing spots, hangliding, etc. Choosing curious would bring up places like museums, local landmarks/monuments, guided tours. Relaxed could show small coffee shops or scenic walking trails along the beach.</li>
						<li>Choosing a playlist displays its average rating and time duration, any comments it has, all the locations in that list, and the path of shortest distance between each location.</li>
						<li>After completing a playlist, users can rate it, comment on it, and leave feedback on how long it took them to complete it.</li>
					</ul>

					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/arlen-paperprototype.JPG" alt="Arlen Paper Prototype">
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/mohsin-paperprototype.jpg" alt="Mohsin Paper Prototype">
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>People were confused when we referred to the trip lists as "playlists", since they associated that with music (which isn't what we wanted), so we decided to scrap that term.</li>
						<li>Liked the first prototype since it seemed clear and simple.</li>
						<li>Confused if users were able to view a pre-existing list and modify it on the go. If not, that would be a nice feature to have since if users find a new location that fits a list they already have, they can edit it instead of creating a whole new list.</li>
					</ul>


					<h5 class="subheaders">First Iteration</h5>
					<p>Our first task was to create a simple map feature using an API of our choice. We decided to go with the Google Maps API because it had the most documentation and seemed like it would do what we wanted for our app. None of us had ever used a map API before, so there was a little learning curve, but since there was a lot of helpful documentation, it wasn't too bad to get the hang of it.</p>
					<p>Personally, I was the one on the team in charge of working with the Google Maps API. The simple map feature I worked on was just displaying a path starting from the user's current location and going through the points/places the user selects from a predetermined list of locations. With another team member, I worked through any issues we came across and figured out how we wanted to organize the user interface of this page.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone5.png" alt="RoadRunner Landing Screen Milestone 5">
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>What if users don't want to start from their current location? The app should allow users to choose whether they want to start from where they are or from one of the destinations on the list.</li>
						<li>There should be a way to allow the user to choose the order in which they visit the different locations.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Second Iteration</h5>
					<p>We took the feedback we received from other teams and decided to focus on the reordering functionality of the app. This would allow users to easily modify the list of destinations if they decide they want to visit one location before another. We also started working on the navbar and making it responsive and testing out different UI choices. We decided to just start from the first location on the list for now until we figured out how we wanted to toggle between starting from the user's current location and the first destination.</p>
					<p>Here, the default list of destinations is submitted and the path is displayed on the map.</p>
					<img src = "imgs/roadrunner/milestone7-1.png" alt="RoadRunner Drag and Reorder Milestone 7-1">
					<p>We then reordered the list by dragging "The Cottage" and switching its order with "Phil's BBQ". We resubmitted the list and a new path is displayed on the map.</p>
					<img src = "imgs/roadrunner/milestone7-2.png" alt="RoadRunner Drag and Reorder Milestone 7-2">
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Love how you can drag and drop locations.</li>
						<li>Currently, you only have pre-filled locations. Next would be implementing the search to allow users to add locations they want.</li>
						<li>Adding more information to the markers on the map would be nice since right now all you have is just the addresses and users won't remember which address corresponds to which location. Having the name of the place would definitely be helpful.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Third Iteration</h5>
					<p>For this iteration, we focused on the add and remove functionality of the destinations. We also improved on improving the overall UI.</p>
					<p>Users can now search for places, which is integrated with the Google Autocomplete feature to help users easily add new destinations.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone9-1.png" alt="RoadRunner Add Function">
					<p>Users can also remove destinations from the list. Each destination has an "X" associated with it, allowing users to delete a place once they click on it. Once they resubmit after removing places, a new path gets generated on the map.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone9-2.png" alt="RoadRunner Remove Function">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone9-3.png" alt="RoadRunner Mobile View">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<p>We also worked on making the app responsive on mobile devices. The navbar collapses into a standard hamburger menu on the upper right. When users click on the "La Jolla Day Trip" banner, the list/trip slides up, showing the destinations as well as the directions (once submitted).</p>
							<h6>Feedback</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Like the UI because it's simple to use and clean.</li>
								<li>Want to be able to save and share lists (need user account feature to be implemented first).</li>
								<li>Want actual labels on the pins/markers instead of just "A" or "B", since it would provide more information on the places and the user won't need to keep looking back at the list to see which marker is associated to which location.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Paper Prototypes (round 2)</h5>
					<p>Each team member designed the Explore and/or Profile pages for our app.</p>
					<p><i>Christy</i> - This is a paper prototype of the Explore page and the Profile page. For the Explore page, users can search with the search bar and type in the title of the list/trip. They can also filter by mood (fixed number of moods). Each card is also color-coded with the mood of the trip. For the Profile page, users can upload an image for themselves and it will also display the lists they created/saved and their favorite lists.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/christy-paperprototype2.jpg" alt="Christy Paper Prototype 2">
					<p><i>Emily</i> - This is a prototype for the Explore and Profile page. The layout is based on grids/cards that the users will be able to scroll through. On the Explore page, users will be able to search for specific keywords or tags. There will be a fixed amount of tags based on moods that users will be able to page through with the arrows and look at. Selecting tags will filter out trips. On the Profile page, users will have their own profile picture and description. They'll also have a two pages containing their saved trips and their own created trips. On either page, selecting a trip will lead them to the map view.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/emily-paperprototype2.png" alt = "Emily Paper Prototype 2">
					<p><i>Arlen</i> - This is also an alternative design of the explore page of our application. It instead tries to put suggested locations on a single map based on starting point which allows points to be continually generated and show up on the map as the user browses around. Futhermore, options are searchable and filterable in this iteration of the explore map.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/arlen-paperprototype2.JPG" alt="Arlen Paper Prototype 2">
					<p><i>Mohsin</i> - This is a prototype of the explore page in our app. It would display lists in the nearby area and users would scroll through the list to choose one they want. If they were looking for a specific list by name, they would use to search bar. Users also have to option to narrow the number of displayed lists with the sort and filter buttons. They would be able to sort by distance or number of locations and filter by tags. Each list displayed would have its name, the locations it contains, and the tags associated with it. On desktop, each list would also show a minimized map view of the overall route.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/mohsin-paperprototype2.jpg" alt="Mohsin Paper Prototype 2">

					<h5 class="subheaders">Fourth Iteration</h5>
					<p>For this iteration, we worked on adding tags to the lists and creating the basic layouts of the Explore and Create pages.</p>
					<p>We added a tagging feature for our lists to allow users to easily search and filter when exploring new destinations.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone11-1.png" alt="RoadRunner Tagging Feature">
					<p>We also created the Explore page (with placeholder images for now). Since most of our paper prototypes used cards/a grid design, we went with that. It's also familiar to users (many grid layouts - Instagram, Pinterest). It has a search bar that will allow users to search and filter through lists. Each card will link back to a page that is similar to our homepage/map page that has the list of places and a map associated with it. As you can see, if you hover over a card, it will display the Trip Name as well as the mood and tags associated with the list.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone11-2.png" alt="RoadRunner Explore Page">
					<p>We also started working on the Create page. We decided to keep the layout the same as the default list page, since users will be more familiar and comfortable with it. It keeps the UI consistent. It has similar functionality to the default list page but the directions have been altered to accommodate the creation of a new list. Ultimately, all of the customization features in the default list will be moved to the Create page.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone11-3.png" alt="RoadRunner Create Page">
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Would like to see time & distance between each location (will give users a general sense of how far apart places are).</li>
						<li>Like the tags, but would like to be able to sort and filter them.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Fifth Iteration</h5>
					<p>We focused on the Create page functionality and User Profile page. We had been incremently working on the backend to set up the database for user accounts in order to allow users to favorite lists and reference them again later on. We also worked on displaying the duration between each place on the list based on previous feedback.</p>
					<p>Here, users can create a new list of destinations. Also, we changed the infoWindow content of the markers so instead of just showing the address, it now displays both the name of the location and the actual address, so that users don't have to remember which address corresponds to which location.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone13-1.png" alt="RoadRunner Create Page 2">
					<p>This is the UI for the profile page, which has separate tabs for the user's lists, their favorites and an option to edit their profile information.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/milestone13-2.png" alt="RoadRunner Profile Page">
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Would like to see total trip time.</li>
						<li>Needs option to start from user's current location.</li>
						<li>Needs functioning explore feature.</li>
						<li>Like the simple and intuitive UI.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Last Iteration</h5>
					<p>This was our last iteration, so it was basically finishing implementing the rest of our features, like the Explore page functionality. We couldn't get to all our planned features ("mood" of list became a more general "tag" feature) and fully flesh out our UI (like the temp Explore page card backgrounds would ideally be the path route of that particular trip list), but we did all we could in the time we had.</p>
					<p>This last iteration was implementing the Explore page, so that lists would actually populate on the page and fleshing out the rest of the UI for that page. We also included a toggle (checkbox) for starting from the user's current location on the list/trip view page. Furthermore, the path will automatically update when you add or remove a location, so that users no longer need a "Submit" button (thus, removing a step in their process).</p>
					<h6>Features</h6>
					<p>Here, the user is signed in (as noted by the navbar - has email in upper right corner and ability to view their own lists + favorites). The user is almost done creating their list. They've added the name, description, locations and a tag.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/create.png" alt="RoadRunner Create Page - Final">
					<p>After they click the "Submit" button, they'll see this page that gets generated with the trip they just created.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/create2.png" alt="RoadRunner After Create">
					<p>Here, users can explore lists other users have created. There is an ability to sort by filters as well as typing in the search bar the names of lists or tags.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/explore-final.png" alt="RoadRunner Explore Page - Final">
					<p>Once the user clicks on a trip/card, they can view it. If signed in, the user can favorite the list and view it from their "Favorites".</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/otherUserList.png" alt="RoadRunner Other User's List">
					<p>Users can view their own lists from their profile.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/mylists.png" alt="RoadRunner My Lists">
					<p>Users can also view their favorites from their profile.</p>
					<img src="imgs/roadrunner/myfavs.png" alt="RoadRunner My Favorites">
					<p>Users can also update their own profiles.</p>

					<h5>Problem</h5>
					<p>Planning social events or hangouts with friends can be difficult, as the process can easily become <span class="emphasize">disorganized</span>. For example, in group chats, people send over multiple Yelp links, which tend to flood the chat window and can also get lost in the conversation. People <span class="emphasize">need a way to save the places they want to go to with their friends</span> in a simple and organized manner.</p>

					<h5>Our Solution</h5>
					<p>With Bucket, users will be able to <span class="emphasize">collaboratively create and edit bucket lists</span> with their different groups of friends. Our mobile-responsive web app is connected with the Yelp API, allowing users to directly search for places they wish to go to straight from our app. Users can create groups, where each group has their own page with all of their respective bucket lists on that page. Each list they create is categorized with the tag name, which organizes all their lists. Users can also archive places they have previously been to. Bucket makes planning future hangouts a hassle-free and stress-free process!</p>

					<h5>Design Opportunity</h5>
					<p>Our design opportunity involved creating new methods of engagement at the Museum of Photographic Arts (MOPA) and bringing in a broader audience for them to educate in the practice of photography. We hoped to design more unique and visitor-centered strategies for attracting new interest in the galleries available at the museum, especially as U.S. attendance in the fine arts are dropping every year. In fact, the data gathered from the past year reveals that, at MOPA specifically, <span class="emphasize">families have made up the lowest proportion of total visitors</span>. Therefore, we aimed to find ways to <span class="emphasize">actively engage families</span> – across multiple generations and between family members. Due to the broad range of ages within a family, we created prototypes that will <span class="emphasize">accommodate varying ages and interests</span> as we hope to engage everyone.

					<h5>Our Proposed Solution</h5>
					<p>Through iterations of user testing and prototyping, we ended up creating <span class="emphasize">family activity cards</span> that would allow all family members to <span class="emphasize">work together creatively & collaboratively</span> and engage with the museum's artwork together.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Primary Research</h5>
					<p>As our first venture in need-finding, we were able to conduct our own field research in order to inform our initial design process. Our previous methods for primary research have included standard interviews, museum observations, and visitor surveys.</p>
					<h6>User Interviews</h6>
					<p>In standard interviews, we conducted in-person user interviews with individuals who’ve had previous experience visiting museums in general. Some general questions included:</p>
					<ul>
				    <li>Did you know that there are museums in Balboa Park? If so, have you been to any one of them?</li>
				    <li>How would you describe a museum?</li>
				    <li>How long has it been since you last went to a museum?</li>
				    <li>What did you like/dislike about the museum?</li>
				    <li>What aspects of a museum attracts you the most?</li>
				    <li>What would you like to see in a museum that you visit?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>From these interviews, we ultimately discovered that <span class="emphasize">the motivation to visit museums is hindered by the lack of engagement and interactivity of the exhibits</span>.</p>
					<h6>In-person Observations</h6>
					<p>To further our research, we visited the museum on two separate occasions for user research. There, we closely observed how people interacted with the exhibit, how they interacted with other visitors in the museum, which exhibits they went to first, and which exhibits they stayed at the longest. We wanted to see what the current users of the museum do when they explore the museum itself.</p>
					<p>From our field research, we found that rather than following the typical layout of the room, <span class="emphasize">visitors gravitated towards exhibits that appeared more interactive</span> and hands-on. As a result, they often <span class="emphasize">skipped over flat exhibits</span> or glanced over them very briefly. The exhibits also had questions posted near the artwork to engage the visitors in critical thinking. However, by the amount of time that they spend at each piece, it is evident that those questions do not provoke engagement.</p>
					<h6>Visitor Surveys</h6>
					<p>While at the museum, we handed out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z2RSjwcLT_Z8UK6HsgJISd_lWWh7NdKo_di7_JB6zHo/viewform" target="_blank">Google Form surveys</a> for visitors to fill out on our tablet. Questions included general topics about museum experiences regarding: how many times they’ve visited a museum in the last 3 months, a description of their last experience visiting a museum, what they liked and what they didn’t like about their experience, and how they interacted with the exhibits at the museum.</p>
					<p>From these survey responses, we found that <span class="emphasize">visitors primarily interacted with museum exhibits by taking photos and by developing their own interpretation of the art</span>. Visitors also generally favored exhibits that were 'thought-provoking'. Finally, when asked what words came to mind when they hear the word 'exhibit,' most listed the word 'interactive'.</p>
					<img src="imgs/mopa/mopa-affinity-diagram.png" alt="MOPA Affinity Diagram">
					<h6>Primary Research Conclusion</h6>
					<p>Ultimately, we discovered from our primary research that in order to create more engaging opportunities for holding visitor attention, we should try creating <span class="emphasize">interactive experiences that keep visitors occupied, connect with them on a personal level, and encourage introspection</span>. In addition, we want to also focus on opportunities that may be <span class="emphasize">extrinsically rewarding</span>.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Design Constraints</h5>
					<p>Due to the financial and physical constraints of MOPA’s exhibition gallery, we were prompted to design a new opportunity that would be <span class="emphasize">cost-efficient, space-efficient, and wouldn’t require extra manpower</span>.</p>
					<p>As a result, we concluded that our design solution needed to address the following key questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Will people need to have known about MOPA before coming to the museum?</li>
						<li>Will our solution be able to involve the whole family?</li>
						<li>Will people be able to take away an experience or souvenir from our solution?</li>
						<li>Is our solution sustainable, and can it be implemented on a low budget?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We needed to find a way that would bring in new interest to the museum in addition to retaining current visitors who would be willing to visit the museum over upcoming years. Therefore, in order to ensure that our solution was not only effective, but also sustainable in the long run, we needed to create a prototype that would be economical and quick to implement within the boundaries of these constraints.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Ideation & Prototyping: Round 1</h5>
					<h6>Ideation</h6>
					<p>Based on our design constraints and the key questions we came up with before, we brainstormed various possible solutions addressing each question. Then we voted on the top 3 ideas and created paper prototypes for them.</p>
					<img src="imgs/mopa/possible-solutions.jpg" alt="MOPA Possible Solutions">
					<h6>Prototype 1</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/proto1.jpg" alt="Prototype 1">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<p>Here, the paper represents a museum wall. At MOPA, there are questions that are written on the wall asking visitors to think about the significance and value of each art piece. However, there is currently no place for visitors to actually answer these questions. Rather than stopping to think about the questions that are available on the wall, visitors tended to overlook it completely. In order to provide the opportunity for the visitors to immerse themselves in with the questions, we felt that we needed to create <span class="emphasize">a space where visitors could leave a piece of themselves behind</span> by being able to post their answers on the wall.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h6>Prototype 2</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/proto2.jpg" alt="Prototype 2">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<p>Here, we have an early prototype of a museum activity card that we are thinking of implementing. While visiting the museum over the weekend, we have noticed that <span class="emphasize">although people tend to go through the room quickly, they don't always look at every exhibit that is available</span>. Some displays naturally stick out more than others. As such, in order to help visitors pace themselves, we were hoping that this stamp card that has visitors identify a photograph from a mosaic will incentivize visitors to go through the entire gallery and look at each exhibit carefully.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h6>Prototype 3</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/proto3.jpg" alt="Prototype 3">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<p>Here, we focused more on how visitors could create their own form of art through putting up personal photos in a particular section of the museum. At the museum, we noticed that there were empty spaces that weren't being used for any of the artwork. After talking with our museum coordinator, Joaquin, we soon found that the structure of the wall simply cannot support the burden of framed photographs. Thus, we proposed the idea of visitors submitting their own Polaroids and printed photographs to be hung up along the wall, possibly with a new theme each month. This way, <span class="emphasize">visitors could see themselves being a part of the museum</span> while also capitalizing on the free space available in the museum.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h6>Feedback</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="four columns">
							<u>Prototype 1</u>
							<ul>
								<li>May appear distracting/intrusive</li>
								<li>Might be weird to just see one post-it next to an exhibit (if not many people have participated)</li>
								<li>Needed physical real estate for post-its</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="four columns">
							<u>Prototype 2</u>
							<ul>
								<li>Liked the idea of a "scavenger hunt" type activity</li>
								<li>Could see kids especially enjoying it</li>
								<li>Stamp cards require additional monitoring from staff, so not feasible</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="four columns">
							<u>Prototype 3</u>
							<ul>
								<li>Liked the idea, but would only work if visitors had already been to MOPA before</li>
								<li>Required visitors to bring their own material</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Rapid Prototyping: Round 2</h5>
					<p>Based on the feedback we received from our peers and research conducted by the museum, we decided to converge on one solution: <strong>the family activity cards</strong> in Prototype 2. As a result, our next round of prototyping involved all of our group members mocking up several versions of the possible activities we could include, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B97HTxnfpnYvdkxpZU5WTk41eFE" target="_blank">all of which can be found in this folder</a>.</p>
					<p>Out of all the prototypes we created, we decided to narrow down to only 2 different versions in order to test them at the museum.</p>
					<h6>Activity 1: Photo Unscramble</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/unscramble-front.png" alt="MOPA Unscramble Front">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/unscramble-back.png" alt="MOPA Unscramble Back">
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>In this activity, kids are prompted to solve a puzzle in a gallery photo hunt. The question “Who helped you complete this activity?” is designed to <span class="emphasize">encourage interaction</span> within the family in this fun activity. On the other hand, the question “What do you think the artist wanted you to notice?” is designed to encourage children completing the activity to reflect on their own personal values and interpretation of the artwork.</p>
					<h6>Activity 2: Find & Sketch</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/find-and-sketch-front.png" alt="MOPA Find and Sketch Front">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/find-and-sketch-back.png" alt="MOPA Find and Sketch Back">
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>In this activity, kids are asked to draw in what they think the rest of the photo will look like, then seek out the exhibit in the gallery to compare what they drew, as a way to <span class="emphasize">spark conversation</span> between one another. On the other side of the card, kids are also encouraged to seek interesting photos of their own, allowing them to form their own opinions about the gallery and the pictures within it.</p>
					<h6>Prototype Testing</h6>
					<p>Going forward with the research questions in mind, we set out to test our prototypes at the museum. We printed multiple low-fidelity copies in order to test them, see the results, and start thinking about the next iteration. As our target audience is families, we decided to go over the weekend where we know the flow of families into the museum was much larger compared to a regular weekday. In total, we asked <b>four different groups of families</b> that day to test out our prototype.</p>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/result1.png" alt="MOPA Result 1">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/result2.png" alt="MOPA Result 2">
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Upon giving the prototypes out to families, they seemed excited and eager to complete the activities. We had several team members stationed throughout the gallery to observe participants in our prototype testing. Ultimately, we found that <span class="emphasize">what people say isn’t necessarily what they do</span>.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="six columns">
							<img src="imgs/mopa/observation1.png" alt="MOPA Observation 1">
						</div>
						<div class="six columns">
							<p>Here, the child & adult are completely split up. While the child is completing the activity alone, the adult is in a different section looking at the artwork.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>While participants often <span class="emphasize">indicated in the card that they worked with family members</span> on the activities, children and parents were <span class="emphasize">in fact split up for most of their time</span> in the gallery. Many adults resolved to watch over their children from afar, some pairs were divided up entirely.</p>
					<p>Despite this, however, parents and children appeared content with how they interacted, as children were able to explore the gallery freely while parents were able to take a short breather and enjoy the exhibit. Also, they did come together at the end to <span class="emphasize">share their experiences</span>.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Design Solution</h5>
					<p>Our final iteration and our ultimate design solution took into account the feedback we received overall from the class and the users we tested it on at MOPA. The key elements for our design solution included having <span class="emphasize">clearer instructions</span> on our cards and <span class="emphasize">having more of the activities that our users favored</span>. We decided to move the instructions from the bottom left to the top, where people tend to look at first. Also, we shrunk the MOPA logo, so that there would be more room for more activities, since that is the main focus of the cards.</p>
					<p>With these activity cards, members of the family are also <span class="emphasize">able to share with one another their interpretation of the pieces at the museum</span>. These activity cards can also be shared with other friends and family members as it’s a little piece of the museum that they can take away. This can create the opportunity for family members to <span class="emphasize">have a meaningful conversation about their museum experience</span>, whether it’s during the time they complete the activity card or after they leave the museum. This furthers our objective of motivating our target audience to continuously come back to the museum to explore the exhibits and engage in such activities to share with family and friends.</p>
					<p>With this last iteration, we took the data that we received from user testing in order to create a design that we believe is more human-centered and will be received well by our target audience. With the subtraction of some design issues (such as eliminating confusing coloring background and confusing instructions placed in unintuitive areas) and the addition of more ideas that resulted from our user testing data, we created this final design solution that we hope will <span class="emphasize">engage family members all around</span> and further continue to <span class="emphasize">motivate them to visit again</span>.</p>

					<h5>Project Overview</h5>
					<p>Lemongrass is a restaurant located at UC San Diego's Price Center. A business that originally began as a stand at farmers' markets around San Diego and at UCSD's weekly farmer's market was given a permanent spot within UCSD due to its overwhelming popularity with the students.</p>
					<p>We offered Pat, the owner, a website redesign; something that kept Lemongrass's <span class="emphasize">organic & natural branding</span>, yet was also <span class="emphasize">youthful & fun</span>.</p>

					<h5>Process</h5>
					<h5 class="subheaders">Client Survey</h5>
					<p>First, we wanted to get a better understanding of our client and the restaurant. We compiled questions to ask our client, such as the background of the restaurant and what types of products they serve. We interpreted her answers and thought about potential design ideas based off of her answers. We also narrowed down our target audience to students & UCSD staff members. We also asked for our client's opinions on branding, colors and design. Read our in-depth <a href="docs/lemongrass/ClientSurvey.pdf" target="_blank">Client Survey</a>.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">User Interviews & Personas</h5>
					<p>Next, we conducted user interviews with members of our target audience: students & UCSD staff members. Questions included:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How often do you eat out? What types of food/restaurants do you eat out at?</li>
						<li>When choosing a new restaurant to try out, what are some factors you consider?</li>
						<li>Do you have a current go-to restaurant? Why do you like your current go-to restaurant?</li>
						<li>How often do you eat at Price Center? What about on-campus in general (like Hi Thai, etc)? Which places do you tend to choose to eat at on-campus? Why those?</li>
						<li>Have you ever been to/eaten at Lemongrass? How often do you eat there?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We asked general questions, as well as different questions for those who have visited/eaten at Lemongrass before and those who have never tried Lemongrass before. We then created three personas based off of the answers we got to see how we can improve the current website for three different, but generic, users. Read more about our <a href="docs/lemongrass/UserInterviews.pdf" target="_blank">User Interviews & Personas</a>.</p>

					<h5 class="subheaders">Competitive Analysis & Mood Boards</h5>
					<p>Then we looked at similar restaurants and analyzed their websites to see how they branded themselves, as well as the general organization and functionality of their sites. This allowed us to find features that we could incorporate into our own website design and gave us a better idea of creating user-friendly interfaces.</p>

							<p><b>What We Found</b><br>The text-heavy paragraph on the old website's homepage was distracting. Users didn't like it and didn't want to read it. However, we still wanted to include something about the owner and her business, because it's an inspiring story.</p>
              <p><b>What We Did</b><br>Thus, we created a separate page for users to read more about Pat, the owner, as well as Lemongrass's background and how it came to be what it is today. We put photos between sections of text to not overwhelm the reader with words.</p>

              <p><b>What We Did</b><br>FHowever, the owner likes getting feedback and suggestions from customers, so we decided to keep this on the site (just as another option for users to write something to Lemongrass). It's just a simple contact form that's easy to use.</p>
